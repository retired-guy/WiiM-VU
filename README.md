# WiiM-VU

Vintage (or modern) VU meters on a wide display with WiiM album art and metadata.  Requires a TosLink input from the WiiM to animate the needles (see resoures below).  Besides the requirements.txt, SDL2 is required for pygame.

Edit config.ini with WiiM's IP address

This is running on a Raspberry Pi 3A+, any RPi should work.
